Summer's over and it's the start of another exciting year of YEGrb meetups!

We're kicking off the year with a meetup all about the RailsRumble. Come prepared to share tips, project ideas, and to find teammates!

We're also excited to announce that we're moving the venue to StartupEdmonton. The UofA has been a great host, and we hope we can continue having events there in the future.
