---

<img src="/images/posts/2010/06/aman_gupta.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" alt="Aman Gupta" />It's hard to believe we're already on to our fourth YEGRB meetup, and this is going to be the best one yet!  Aman Gupta (<a href="http://github.com/tmm1">github</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmm1">twitter</a>) will be joining us via the web to present "Debugging Ruby: understanding and troubleshooting the VM and your application".  Aman is a serial entrepreneur, ruby hacker and a recent winner of a Ruby Heroes award. He currently maintains the EventMachine project and various other gems that help build high-performance distributed and asynchronous systems in ruby, including em-mysql, em-spec, jsSocket and amqp.

Most recently, Aman has been hacking on performance improvements to MRI, and tools for the VM such as perftools.rb, a sampling profiler for ruby code based on google-perftools, and gdb.rb, a MRI specific version of gdb.

We've setup a <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=c9f4">Google Moderator channel to collect questions for Aman</a> in advance of his talk.  Submit your questions early and vote on the ones you're most interested in so that we make maximum use of his time.  You can also record a YouTube video of yourself asking your question.

The meetup will be taking place on June 15th @ 18:30 MST.  Please <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dHhCUmZxSzlmbFJCeGZ0MWtLcXNib2c6MA#gid=0">RSVP in advance</a>.  We're making some special arrangements for this months venue and will announce the location details later on this week.

Thanks to Daniel (<a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive">@darkhelmetlive</a>) for setting this talk up!
