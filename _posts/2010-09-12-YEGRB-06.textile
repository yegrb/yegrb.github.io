With the arrival of September the Ruby Meetup are back and ready to rumble!  RailsRumble that is!

This month's meetup is about preparing YEGRB members to participate in the "RailsRumble":http://railsrumble.com in October.  The rumble is a yearly competition that pits developers from around the world together in a contest to develop and deploy an application in 48-hours.  The competition can be fierce but the experience can be just what you need to get an edge in your Rails development.

This month's speakers include:

* "@mdeering":http://twitter.com/mdeering - Advanced Capistrano deployments
* "@benzittlau":http://twitter.com/benzittlau - Using CSS frameworks
* "@cbrulak":http://twitter.com/cbrulak - Adding OpenID to your app
* "@markbennett":http://twitter.com/markbennett - RailsRumble checklist
