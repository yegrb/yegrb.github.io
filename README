This repository contains the home page for YEGRB, the Edmonton Ruby User Group.

Development setup
===================

To setup an environment to develop and change the website just clone this repo and then:

    bundle install --binstubs

The static files are build into the _site folder, but if you want to serve them to the web browser jekyll can be run as a server:

    bin/jekyll server -w

This will serve the pages on port 4000, and automatically rebuild the site when files in _posts or _layouts change.

You can also enable rendering of files in the _drafts folder with:

    bin/jekyll server -w --drafts


Deploying to yegrb.com
=======================

If you have permission to write to the YEGrb site repo then you can deploy your changes to http://yegrb.com with git:

    git push origin master

Otherwise create a fork on GitHub and send us a pull request.
